# Project Assessment Rubric

**Project:** SkyLink Flight Management System
**Section:** C2B
**Course:** Object Oriented Programming

## Grading Breakdown

### 1. Class Diagram Completeness (25%)
**Score:** 2/5
**Notes:** No class diagram found in the project directory. The README.md contains extensive documentation of classes and their relationships in text format, which is helpful but not a substitute for a visual UML class diagram. A proper class diagram showing relationships, inheritance hierarchies, and associations is missing.

### 2. Java Program - OOP Concepts (50%)
**Score:** 5/5
**Notes:** Exceptional implementation of all four OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation:** Excellent use of private fields with public getters/setters throughout (Aircraft, Person, PaymentMethod classes)
- **Inheritance:** Complex inheritance hierarchy with Person as abstract base class extended by Passenger; multiple inheritance patterns evident
- **Polymorphism:** Abstract methods (getRoleDescription() in Person, pay() in PaymentMethod) overridden in concrete classes; extensive use of polymorphic behavior
- **Abstraction:** Multiple abstract classes (Person, PaymentMethod) and extensive use of interfaces and enums (AircraftStatus, EngineStatus)
The project demonstrates sophisticated OOP design with over 100+ Java classes showing enterprise-level architecture.

### 3. Git Usage & Collaboration (15%)
**Score:** 4/5
**Notes:** Good collaboration with 4 contributors: Zach-arizz (35 commits), SAKAMOTOprog (5 commits), Michael Ong (1 commit), and jho (1 commit). One dominant contributor but clear evidence of team participation.

### 4. Base Grade (10%)
**Score:** 5/5
